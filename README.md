## Audio Dataset Analysis for Laplacian Noise estimation
This study explores the analysis of audio datasets for Laplacian noise estimation.
With noise being a significant concern in audio applications, we propose techniques to estimate Laplacian noise parameters directly from audio data.
Our framework includes parameter estimation, correlation analysis, alongside statistical modeling and joint probability density evaluation methodologies used to estimate the Laplacian noise of audio dataset are all thoroughly investigated in this research.
